# sheetprepautomation
The initial csv file is not optimally organised and there may be many assets which are not present locally/remotely. So, the task is to map out a better organised csv file and let the user know about the missing assets which are to be used in the campaign. It also covers fuzzy search as there may be small error in the name of the assets due to human error and this process will allow the user to look into the suggested assets present in the remote/local storage system. The user then can authenticate the suggested asset name changes and this will update the sheet.
